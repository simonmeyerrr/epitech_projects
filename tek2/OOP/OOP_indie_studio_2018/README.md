# Indie Studio

Indie Studio is the end of the second year project at Epitech.

The objective was to create a complete Bomberman game in CPP with the 3D library [Irrlicht](http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/) Windows and Linux compatible. We also used the [SFML Audio](https://www.sfml-dev.org) library for sound management.

## Compilation

#### Linux

1. Install Irrlicht 1.8.4 on your machine by using your package manager or by downloading and compiling it by yourself [here](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/irrlicht/irrlicht-1.8.4.zip)

2. Install sfml-aduio and sfml-system 2.4.2 on your machine by using your package manager or by downloading it by yourself [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.4.2/)

3. Clone this repository and use this commands:

	```sh
	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake ..
	$ make
	```

4. `bomberman` have been created at the root of the project folder.

5. You can use the script `setup_application.sh` at the root of the repository to make the game accessible from anywhere on your computer.
