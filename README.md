# Epitech Projects

**Some repositories and documentation are missing, this will come later.**

You will find in this repository all my projects realized during my studies at Epitech. 
I advise you not to reuse this code because:
- The topics have changed and the code doesn't necessarily reflect what is expected.
- The code is not always working correctly. (I'm not perfect)
- The code no longer meets the Epitech's coding style.
- You're going to get flag cheater and get a **`-42`**.
